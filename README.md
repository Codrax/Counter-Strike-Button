# Counter Strike Button
Rebind Counter-Strike 2: Global Offensive

## Information
The app intercepts the CAPS-LOCK key when the process `explorer.exe` is focused and opens Counter-Strike 2: Global Offensive :)

### Important
You will need to manually add a Task Scheduler task to automatically run the app at startup. I didn't have time to make an installed and add such a feature.
